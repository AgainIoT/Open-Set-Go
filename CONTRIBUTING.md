### Code of Conduct
The maintainers who started the project are undergraduates of Kookmin University in South Korea. That's why we use English and Korean alternately. Of course, the project is based on English, but we welcome the contributions of both English and Korean.
~~_Don't be afraid We love English, too_~~

이 프로젝트를 시작한 maintainer들은 한국의 국민대학교 학부생들입니다. 그렇기 때문에 우리는 영어와 한국어를 같이 사용하고 있습니다. 물론, 프로젝트는 영어를 기반으로 하고 있지만, 영어와 한국어를 사용하는 기여를 모두 환영하고 있습니다. ~~_겁내지 말아요. 저희는 한국어를 사랑합니다._~~
